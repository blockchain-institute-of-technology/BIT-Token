# BIT Token

The Blockchain Institute of Technology is raising money to purchase a permanent building to expand on the awesome intellectual and productive work being achieved by New Hampshire seacoast individuals in our space. Our landlord has recently put our building up for sale so we have the incredible opportunity to establish a permanent home for BIT in Portsmouth!

Investors in our BIT token are crypto-wealthy individuals and blockchain enthusiasts who want to see a culture of decentralization through technology flourish throughout the New England Seacoast.

By sending ETH to the contract address our sponsors receive two BIT tokens for each ETH. The Institute will accept BIT tokens at the value of one BIT equals one ETH for all goods and services.

The crowd-sale will end when 25,000 ETH is raised, leaving a total of 50,000 BIT tokens available in circulation. The Blockchain Institute of Technology accepts BIT tokens at a face value of one BIT per ETH, so for every $1 in demand for BIT services (courses, lectures, events, rent, etc) sponsors may earn back up to $2 by buying services or by selling the tokens on the open market to other patrons or students wishing to attend The Institute.
